This project - 'Lab4B' - was made during my time at Mohawk College; it was made using Visual Studio 2019.

A debug .exe variant can be found further in the Lab4B/bin/Debug/Lab4B.exe; this does not require Visual Studio 2019 to run.

This app serves to check as to whether HTML tags are 'balanced' (that is: they have a matching close-tag) within a given .HTML file.

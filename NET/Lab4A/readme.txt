This project - 'Lab4A' - was made during my time at Mohawk College; it was made using Visual Studio 2019.

A debug .exe variant can be found further in the Lab4A/bin/Debug/Lab4A.exe; this does not require Visual Studio 2019 to run.

This program takes an existing employees.txt file, reads it, and then displays it to the user. The user is allowed to sort the employees
using a different number of given methods.

This project - 'RecyclingWebsite' (alternatively known as 'lab03') - was made during my time at Mohawk College; it was made entirely
using Notepad++. 

This is a simple sample 'recycling page' website.

NOTE: All of the CSS on this website for this particular project is in the .HTML file. I am aware that this is not good practice; it was
made in a time during my learning of CSS.

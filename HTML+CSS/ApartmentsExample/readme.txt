This project - 'ApartmentsExample' (alternatively known as 'lab06) - was made during my time at Mohawk College; it was made entirely
using Notepad++.

It uses a (now dated) 'map' function on the image in the middle to locate the user to the different webpages for the apartment; alternatively,
the user can just navigate to the various webpages using the tabs listed.

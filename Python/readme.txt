This folder contains various Python projects I have created during my time at Mohawk College.

'addressChecker' is a simple address-checking application. If there are any errors with the given address, it will store the errors in a
list and then display them to the user at the end.

'listsLab' is A simple project involving creating either a one-dimensional or two-dimensional list. With a one-dimensional list, 
it will sort the objects inside. With a two-dimensional list, it is numbers-exclusive and will make a power table.

The final project I worked on was the 'RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock' game: it is a game in which the user plays Tic-Tac-Toe versus
another player. Once a player enters a square, they then have to contest over that square in a game of 
'Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock' - a five-option game. The winner of the minigame gets that square. The game is replayable upon
ending (if the user chooses).

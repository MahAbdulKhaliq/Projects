Included here is a sample of one of my projects in an ASP.NET Web Application course - this course touches on the idea of generating web content through (some) included
ASP.NET features, such as Razor Pages; also, it makes heavy use of Entity Framework.

Included is Northwind.sql - a sample script that can be used to generate the database locally.

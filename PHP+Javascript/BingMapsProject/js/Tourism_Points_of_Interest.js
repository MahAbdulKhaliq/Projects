Although I have experimented with a variety of subject matter, in my paintings I most frequently choose nature and wildlife, as I believe God created the world and I take delight in emphasizing its beauty, particularity and diversity. I especially enjoy unique angles on nature, animals and still life subjects. I am also fascinated by the weathering effects of nature and the elements on architectural structures as they age. The interaction between the natural world and manmade structures is of particular interest to me, often giving rise to metaphors which highlight truth, beauty and the longing for ultimate restoration in the world.",
